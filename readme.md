Yardstick is an open source tool designed to run your benchmark software for you. Some roadmap bullet points:

* Authenticate to your Comparebench account
* Upload your computer profile (hardware specs) to add benchmark results to it.
* View all your uploaded profiles, view past benchmark results

Currently supports running Cinebench R20. Does not support the windows store version.
